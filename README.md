## Project Update - Oct 2019 ##
Thanks to everyone in the community that has contributed to the very first nonprofit superbadge! This project is currently on hold, but here's the summary of what we've accomplished so far, and what we hope to do next:

At the Detroit Community Sprint in July 2019, the SFDO Content Adoption Team (CATeam) and members of the community came together to create the list of requirements/task an admin should know as a fundraising specialist and how someone can demonstrate their knowledge and ability via a Trailhead superbadge. After the Detroit Sprint, the CATeam returned to their caves and began organizing the requirments into something that resembled a story. Developing and publishing Trailhead content, however, is a team sport. A month after the Sprint, the CATeam pressed pause on the project to better accommodate the priorities and timelines their internal teammates. 

The CATeam would love to continue working with the community on this project, and will be in touch with the original community collaborators when content development resumes. In the meantime, contact the Project Leaders (listed below) with any question or comments. 

Thank you for everything you do! We couldn't create this content without the thoughtful and thorough input from community members. 

### Let’s Write a Superbadge!
Brainstorming and drafting content for a fundraising specialist superbadge. 

### What's this all about?
We’d like to work with the community to develop advanced Trailhead content! We’re in the initial stages for developing a superbadge on fundraising for admins, hoping to partner with people familiar with this topic that would like to help create and test training content. Our Sprint goal is to brainstorm and draft the various Trailhead pieces we need to create, polish, and publish the first nonprofit superbadge.

### Who should work on this? 
You love (or love-hate) writing, have ideas about improving content or learning, are familiar with using NPSP for fundraising. 

### Project Info
Here's a link to the [project info details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jk49ZMCronDZ20KGF289I8GvF9tReeOwRRDTpu6kkaA/edit#). We've decided that we're going to write in Google Docs, so we'll be using Google Drive and Docs for our development, as well. That includes our Sprint brainstorming! Here's a link to [the Google Doc we're working from](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aqlcrjbAb4fVPVo5x4kXVl1AxHHyLhCq).

### Project Team Detroit Sprint Accomplishments & Next Steps
We drafted the requirements and test that an admin needs to complete to earn a fundraising superbadge! Next steps are to incorporate comments into draft, and then review and edit again, like you have to do with all documentation forever and ever.  
If you want to help in the next version, let us know!
