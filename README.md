### Let’s Write a Superbadge!
Brainstorming and drafting content for a fundraising specialist superbadge. 

### What's this all about?
We’d like to work with the community to develop advanced Trailhead content! We’re in the initial stages for developing a superbadge on fundraising for admins, hoping to partner with people familiar with this topic that would like to help create and test training content. Our Sprint goal is to brainstorm and draft the various Trailhead pieces we need to create, polish, and publish the first nonprofit superbadge.

### Who should work on this? 
You love (or love-hate) writing, have ideas about improving content or learning, are familiar with using NPSP for fundraising. 

### Project Info
Here's a link to the [project info details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jk49ZMCronDZ20KGF289I8GvF9tReeOwRRDTpu6kkaA/edit#). We've decided that we're going to write in Google Docs, so we'll be using Google Drive and Docs for our development, as well. That includes our Sprint brainstorming! Here's a link to [the Google Doc we're working from](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aqlcrjbAb4fVPVo5x4kXVl1AxHHyLhCq).
